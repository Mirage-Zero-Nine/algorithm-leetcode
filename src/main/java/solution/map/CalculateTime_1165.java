/**
 * There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.
 * Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard, initially your finger is at index 0.
 * To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character.
 * The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.
 * You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.
